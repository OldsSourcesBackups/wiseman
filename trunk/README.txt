WISEMAN 1.0

This is the 1,0 binary release of Wiseman, an implementation of the WS Management 
protocol for Java JDK 5.0.

This release provides good coverage of the WS Man 1.0 specification
which can be found at http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman. Documentation
is still under development for this product and will be updated soon.

To begin learning about Wiseman look over the samples in the samples 
directory and try the 'server_guide' and the 'tutorial' documents in the docs directory.  

While learning more about Wiseman, you will also find CVS resources in the  
se/tools/docs/developer directory the unit tests for wiseman to 
be a useful source of examples. Unit tests for the client and server (SE) projects 
are provided including tests used in the last multi vendor interop which cover most 
of the specification. If you need to see how something is done look there as well.
