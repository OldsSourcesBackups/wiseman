<h3>Contributing to Wiseman</h3>

<p>To contribute to the project, please join the project as an
Observer, download, print and sign the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/contributor_agreement.jsp">Contributor Agreement</a>
and fax it back to Sun at +1 408-715-2540 or scan and email it to <a href="mailTo:sun_ca@sun.com">sun_ca@sun.com</a>.
Once approved, the agreement will be then published on the 
<a href="https://sca.dev.java.net/CA_signatories.htm">Sun Contributor Agreement Signatories List</a>.
Contributions can be accepted once the agreement has been approved. After several
high-quality contributions, an Observer may be upgraded to Developer
and granted write access to the repository.</p>

<p>The wiseman project requires contributors to jointly assign
their copyright on contributed code. The Sun Contributor Agreement
(SCA) gives Sun and the contributor joint copyright interests in the
code: the contributor retains copyrights while also granting those
rights to Sun as the open source project sponsor. By executing the SCA,
contributors protect the Wiseman code base, enable alternative
licensing models, and protect the flexibility to adapt the project to
the changing demands of the community. In order for the SCA to be
effective, the wiseman project must obtain an assignment for all
contributions. Please review the SCA for a complete understanding of
its terms and conditions.</p>
