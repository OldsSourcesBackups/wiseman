</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">March 2nd, 2007</p>

<p>The 0.6 binary release of the Wiseman project now features JAX-WS deployment. 
We are in the process of adding more support to embrace the newer annotation focused 
development of web services.  We are also renewing efforts to update the  
documentation of the existing libraries/functionality for the next release. 
A few enhancements and bug fixes over the previous release have also been added.<br>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Dec 12th, 2006</p>

<p>Wiseman at MDC (<a href="http://www.mandevcon.com/">http://www.mandevcon.com/</a>).
The Wiseman project was the topic of a presentation at the Management
Developers Conference last week in San Jose, CA.&nbsp; A general
status
and update on what we have implemented was given including details on
our client library and upcomming JMX support. The slides are available
online at <a href="https://wiseman.dev.java.net/preso/mdc/MDC_2006_WSMan_and_Wiseman.pdf">https://wiseman.dev.java.net/preso/mdc/MDC_2006_WSMan_and_Wiseman.pdf</a></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sept 18th, 2006</p>

<p>The Wiseman project has produced its first binary release!
Release 0.5
provides good coverage of the DMTF 1.0a Version of the WS Management
specification. This release features a tutorial on creating and
exposing resources starting from your schema though generating a Java
web application. It also contains sample client and server applications.<br>

</p>

<h3>Developer Documentation</h3>

<p> We are starting to add developer documentation to the
project. There is a lot of catching up to do, but as you work with
wiseman, please take notes, send emails, and look for useful
documentation to add. Also, please start heavily JavaDoc'ing your code
going forward. We would like to have a fully documnted build soon. Go
to the <a href="documentation.html">documentation index</a>
for more information. </p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>To contribute to the project, please join the project as an
Observer, download, print and sign the <a href="ContributorAgreement.pdf">Contributor Agreement</a>
and fax it back to Sun at +1 408-715-2540 or scan and email it to <a href="mailTo:sun_ca@sun.com">sun_ca@sun.com</a>.
Once approved, the agreement will be then published on the <a href="http://www.sunsource.net/CA_signatories">Sun Contributor Agreement Signatories List</a>.
Contributions can be accepted once the agreement has been received. After several
high-quality contributions, an Observer may be upgraded to Developer
and granted write access to the repository.</p>

<p>The wiseman project requires contributors to jointly assign
their copyright on contributed code. The Sun Contributor Agreement
(SCA) gives Sun and the contributor joint copyright interests in the
code: the contributor retains copyrights while also granting those
rights to Sun as the open source project sponsor. By executing the SCA,
contributors protect the Wiseman code base, enable alternative
licensing models, and protect the flexibility to adapt the project to
the changing demands of the community. In order for the SCA to be
effective, the wiseman project must obtain an assignment for all
contributions. Please review the SCA for a complete understanding of
its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>Background Information</h3>

<p>The specifications implemented in the wiseman project include:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman">WS-Management,
</a><a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0226.pdf">DMTF
DSP0226</a></p>

<p>This specification identifies a core set of Web service
specifications and usage requirements to expose a common set of
operations that are central to all systems management. This comprises
the abilities to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Discover the presence of management resources and navigate
between them</li>

  <li>Get, Put, Create, Rename, and Delete individual management
resources, such as settings and dynamic values</li>

  <li>Enumerate the contents of containers and collections, such
as large tables and logs</li>

  <li>Subscribe to events emitted by managed resources</li>

  <li>Execute specific management methods with strongly typed
input and output parameters</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="specs/2005/06/catalog.pdf">WS-Management
Catalog, 2005/06</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a metadata format for the discovery
of management functionality of resources, or endpoints. As
WS-Management supports the concept of multiple logical endpoints
residing at the same network address, this specification defines a
construct for a list of available logical endpoints or "resources",
their summary forms, compatible actions, schemas, and WSDL
representations.</p>

<p><a href="specs/2004/08/addressing.pdf">WS-Addressing,
2004/08</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a construct to identify/reference a
Web service endpoint for access and for addressing messages between
endpoints, and it defines a construct of message information headers
allowing uniform addressing of messages independent of underlying
transport.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/09/ws-enumeration/">WS-Enumeration,
2004/09</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a simple SOAP-based protocol for
the transfer of large data sets. Enumeration of the data by the
consumer is facilitated through a session abstraction, allowing the
consumer to request XML element information items from the data source
over the span of one or more SOAP messages.</p>

<p><a href="specs/2004/08/eventing.pdf">WS-Eventing,
2004/08</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a protocol for a Web service to
register interest with another Web service in order to receive messages
about events. The subscriber may manage the subscription by interacting
with a Web service designated by the event source.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/09/ws-transfer/">WS-Transfer,
2004/09</a></p>

<p>This specification defines operations using Web services
infrastructure for sending and receiving XML representations of a
resource and for creating and deleting a resource and its corresponding
representation.</p>
