<H3>Quick Start Guide</H3>
<P>This guide describes the basic steps for getting dependencies
required by wiseman, downloading wiseman, compiling it, and
completing your first successful run of wiseman. As wiseman is in a
development state at the moment, these instructions will include some
necessary build steps and manual movements of files. Over time, these
will be simplified and changed.</P>

<P>Downloading and installing the proper versions of dependencies is
critical for running the wiseman project. Backlevel dependencies, in
particular, can cause difficult to debug problems. Often, &ldquo;newer&rdquo;
versions of the dependencies will be fine but we strongly recommend
that you stay with the recommended software dependencies listed in
this section.</P>

<H3><A NAME="download"></A>Download wiseman</H3>
<P>For now, wiseman is available in <i>source</i> form only.  As a result, check
out the source from the CVS tree using the 
<a href="https://wiseman.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource#wincvs">instructions 
located on the project site</a>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="configure"></A>Configure</H3>
<P>
There are several configuration steps necessary to get everything ready to build
and deploy into your running Tomcat instance.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Move JAXB libraries from open source installation to the wiseman/se/lib/jaxb directory
(for me, this is "cp /home/pm141145/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/jaxb-ri-20060426/lib/*.jar se/lib/jaxb/")
<LI>Move the SAAJ libraries libraries to the wiseman/se/lib/jaxrpc directory
(for me, this is "cp /home/pm141145/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/saaj*.jar se/lib/jaxrpc/")
<LI>Copy the Servlet API jar from your favorite servlet container to the root library
directory.  For Tomcat, we are using servlet-api.jar from the ./apache-tomcat-5.5.17/common/lib/
directory.  (for me, the copy command is cp ~/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/common/lib/servlet-api.jar se/lib/)
<LI>Copy the junit.jar file from your JUnit download to the wiseman/se/lib directory.
Also copy the junit.jar file to the wiseman/se/test/lib directory.
<LI>Edit the wiseman/se/project.properties file, ensure the properties are set
for  your configuration, also:
<UL>
<LI>If you do not have an environment variable for the location of your app server, add one
here.  For Tomcat, this is the "catalina.home" variable.  I added an entry:
catalina.home=/home/pm141145/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/apache-tomcat-5.5.17
</UL>
<LI>Edit the tomcat-users.xml file and add the following entries (don't add if they already exist):
<pre>
&lt;role rolename="manager"/&gt;
&lt;role rolename="wsman"/&gt;
&lt;role rolename="admin"/&gt;
&lt;user username="wsman" password="secret" roles="wsman"//&gt;
&lt;user username="admin" password="adminadmin" roles="admin,manager"/&gt;
</pre>

</UL>
<H3><A NAME="compile"></A>Compile and Run</H3>
<P>Run the following ant targets from the wiseman/se directory (make sure your tomcat instance is running):</P>
<ul>
<li>ant clean
<li>ant
<li>ant deploy
<li>ant test
</ul>
<P>If the test target runs properly, you have successfully completed installation.
