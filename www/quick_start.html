<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
<p>This guide describes the basic steps for getting dependencies
required by wiseman, downloading wiseman, compiling it, and
completing your first successful run of wiseman. As wiseman is in a
development state at the moment, these instructions will include some
necessary build steps and manual movements of files. Over time, these
will be simplified and changed.<br>
</p>
<p>The Quick Start Guide currently ONLY covers the se branch of the
wiseman code, this is the server, client code and handlers.&nbsp; The
other primary branch, mapping, is not currently covered in this
document.<br>
</p>
<h3>Quick Start Updates</h3>

<h3><a name="dependencies"></a>Dependencies</h3>
<p>Downloading and installing the proper versions of dependencies is
critical for running the wiseman project. Backlevel dependencies, in
particular, can cause difficult to debug problems. Often, &#8220;newer&#8221;
versions of the dependencies will be fine but we strongly recommend
that you stay with the recommended software dependencies listed in
this section.</p>

<h3><a name="download"></a>Download wiseman</h3>
<p>For now, wiseman is available in <i>source</i> form only. As a
result, check
out the source from the CVS tree using the <a
 href="https://wiseman.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource#wincvs">instructions
located on the project site</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="configure"></a>Configure</h3>
<p>
There are several configuration steps necessary to get everything ready
to build
and deploy into your running Tomcat instance.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The se/lib/jaxb/README file contains a list of required .jar
files from the JAXB download.&nbsp; Copy the files listed in the README
from the open source installation to the se/lib/jaxb directory
(for me, this is "cp
/home/pm141145/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/jaxb-ri-20060426/lib/[listedfile].jar
se/lib/jaxb/")
  </li>
  <li>Copy the SAAJ libraries libraries to the wiseman/se/lib/jaxrpc
directory
(for me, this is "cp
/home/pm141145/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/saaj*.jar
se/lib/jaxrpc/")
  </li>
  <li>Copy the Servlet API jar from your favorite servlet container to
the root library
directory. For Tomcat, we are using servlet-api.jar from the
./apache-tomcat-5.5.17/common/lib/
directory. (for me, the copy command is cp
~/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/common/lib/servlet-api.jar
se/lib/)
  </li>
  <li>Copy the junit.jar file from your JUnit download to the
se/test/lib directory.
  </li>
  <li>Review the wiseman/se/project.properties file to ensure the
properties are set
for your configuration.&nbsp; The defaults should be OK for running the
first time.&nbsp; Also:
    <ul>
      <li>ant requires a "catalina.home" variable if you are using
Tomcat as your application server, if one is not set in your
environment, locate the .ant.properties file that comes with your Ant
installation and add it.&nbsp; You could also, as a last resort,&nbsp;
add the variable to the project.properties file, though you may risk
accidentally checking it in if you have write permissions.&nbsp; I
added an entry:
catalina.home=/home/pm141145/downloads/wiseman_dependencies/apache-tomcat-5.5.17
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Edit the tomcat-users.xml file and add the following entries
(don't add if they already exist):
    <pre>&lt;role rolename="wsman"/&gt;<br>&lt;user username="wsman" password="secret" roles="wsman"/&gt;<br></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="compile"></a>Compile and Run</h3>
<p>Run the following ant targets from the wiseman/se directory (make
sure your tomcat instance is running):</p>
<ul>
  <li>ant test
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the test target runs properly, you have successfully completed
installation.<br>
</p>
<p>There are other ant targets that are worth knowing about:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>deploy - deploys the application to Tomcat</li>
  <li>compile - compiles the primary code path</li>
  <li>test-compile - compiles just the test cases<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Common_Problems"></a>Common Problems</h3>
<ol>
  <li>On the first time through, the Tomcat server may have to be
restarted if you see errors.&nbsp; During deployment, several libraries
are moved into the application server's path and restarting Tomcat will
get them all loaded properly.<br>
  </li>
  <li>When you re-deploy wiseman, you may see one of several different
common errors (LOC Header invalid, etc...) embodied as Java stack
traces.&nbsp; Restart Tomcat and re-run the tests.</li>
</ol>
