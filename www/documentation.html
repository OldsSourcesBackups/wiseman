of management functionality of resources, or endpoints. As
WS-Management supports the concept of multiple logical endpoints

their summary forms, compatible actions, schemas, and WSDL
representations.</p>

      <p>This specification defines a simple SOAP-based protocol for

<h3><a name="howtocontribute"></a>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>Contributing documentation to the project is the same as
contributing code to the project.
Obviously, existing documentation always needs updates, especially when
new dependency versions
are put out or substantial updates are made to the code. You may also
consider looking at the ToDo list for a document to write from scratch.
Finally, if you feel there is a gap in the documentation
feel free to address it yourself and contribute it back to the project.
</p>
<p>To contribute documentation to the project, please join the project
as an Observer, download, print and sign the <a
 href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Contributor Agreement</a> and fax it
back to Sun at +1 408 404 8042. Contributions can be accepted once the
agreement has been received. After several high-quality contributions,
an Observer may be upgraded to Developer and granted write access to
the repository.</p>
<p>The wiseman project requires contributors to jointly assign their
copyright on contributed code. The Sun Contributor Agreement (SCA)
gives Sun and the contributor joint copyright interests in the code:
the contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to
Sun as the open source project sponsor. By executing the SCA,
contributors protect the wiseman code base, enable alternative
licensing models, and protect the flexibility to adapt the project to
the changing demands of the community. In order for the SCA to be
effective, the wiseman project must obtain an assignment for all
contributions. Please review the SCA for a complete understanding of
its terms and conditions.</p>
