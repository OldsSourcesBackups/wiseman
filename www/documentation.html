			<P><A HREF="specs/2005/06/catalog.pdf">WS-Management
			Catalog, 2005/06</A></P>
		</TD>
		<TD>
			<P>This specification defines a metadata format for the discovery
			of management functionality of resources, or endpoints. As
			WS-Management supports the concept of multiple logical endpoints
			residing at the same network address, this specification defines a
			construct for a list of available logical endpoints or
			&quot;resources&quot;, their summary forms, compatible actions,
			schemas, and WSDL representations.</P>

		</TD>
		<TD>
			<P>This specification defines a construct to identify/reference a
			Web service endpoint for access and for addressing messages
			between endpoints, and it defines a construct of message
			information headers allowing uniform addressing of messages
			independent of underlying transport.</P>

		</TD>
		<TD>
			<P>This specification defines a simple SOAP-based protocol for the
			transfer of large data sets. Enumeration of the data by the
			consumer is facilitated through a session abstraction, allowing
			the consumer to request XML element information items from the
			data source over the span of one or more SOAP messages.</P>

		</TD>
		<TD>
			<P>This specification defines a protocol for a Web service to
			register interest with another Web service in order to receive
			messages about events. The subscriber may manage the subscription
			by interacting with a Web service designated by the event source.</P>

<H3><A NAME="howtocontribute"></A>How to Contribute</H3>
<p>Contributing documentation to the project is the same as contributing code to the project.
Obviously, existing documentation always needs updates, especially when new dependency versions
are put out or substantial updates are made to the code.  You may also consider looking at 
the ToDo list for a document to write from scratch.  Finally, if you feel there is a gap in the documentation
feel free to address it yourself and contribute it back to the project.
</p>
  <p>To contribute documentation to the project, please join the project 
  as an Observer, download, print and sign the 
  <a href="ContributorAgreement.pdf">Contributor 
  Agreement</a> and fax it back to Sun at +1 408 404 8042. 
  Contributions can be accepted once the agreement has been received. 
  After several high-quality contributions, an Observer may be upgraded to 
  Developer and granted write access to the repository.</p>
  
  <p>The wiseman project requires contributors to jointly assign their 
  copyright on contributed code. The Sun Contributor Agreement (SCA) gives Sun 
  and the contributor joint copyright interests in the code: the contributor 
  retains copyrights while also granting those rights to Sun as the open 
  source project sponsor. By executing the SCA, contributors protect the 
  wiseman code base, enable alternative licensing models, and protect the 
  flexibility to adapt the project to the changing demands of the community. 
  In order for the SCA to be effective, the wiseman project must obtain an 
  assignment for all contributions. Please review the SCA for a complete 
  understanding of its terms and conditions.</p>
