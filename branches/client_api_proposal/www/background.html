<h3>Background Information</h3>

<p>The specifications implemented in the wiseman project include:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman">WS-Management,
</a><a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0226.pdf">DMTF
DSP0226</a></p>

<p>This specification identifies a core set of Web service
specifications and usage requirements to expose a common set of
operations that are central to all systems management. This comprises
the abilities to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Discover the presence of management resources and navigate
between them</li>

  <li>Get, Put, Create, Rename, and Delete individual management
resources, such as settings and dynamic values</li>

  <li>Enumerate the contents of containers and collections, such
as large tables and logs</li>

  <li>Subscribe to events emitted by managed resources</li>

  <li>Execute specific management methods with strongly typed
input and output parameters</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="specs/2005/06/catalog.pdf">WS-Management
Catalog, 2005/06</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a metadata format for the discovery
of management functionality of resources, or endpoints. As
WS-Management supports the concept of multiple logical endpoints
residing at the same network address, this specification defines a
construct for a list of available logical endpoints or "resources",
their summary forms, compatible actions, schemas, and WSDL
representations.<br></br><b>***NOTE: This specification was never updated
to use the DMTF namespace and is currently incompatible with the 
WS-Management specification defined above.  When the Catalog specification
is updated to be compatible then code supporting such changes 
will be included.</b>
</p>

<p><a href="specs/2004/08/addressing.pdf">WS-Addressing,
2004/08</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a construct to identify/reference a
Web service endpoint for access and for addressing messages between
endpoints, and it defines a construct of message information headers
allowing uniform addressing of messages independent of underlying
transport.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/09/ws-enumeration/">WS-Enumeration,
2004/09</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a simple SOAP-based protocol for
the transfer of large data sets. Enumeration of the data by the
consumer is facilitated through a session abstraction, allowing the
consumer to request XML element information items from the data source
over the span of one or more SOAP messages.</p>

<p><a href="specs/2004/08/eventing.pdf">WS-Eventing,
2004/08</a></p>

<p>This specification defines a protocol for a Web service to
register interest with another Web service in order to receive messages
about events. The subscriber may manage the subscription by interacting
with a Web service designated by the event source.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/09/ws-transfer/">WS-Transfer,
2004/09</a></p>

<p>This specification defines operations using Web services
infrastructure for sending and receiving XML representations of a
resource and for creating and deleting a resource and its corresponding
representation.</p>
