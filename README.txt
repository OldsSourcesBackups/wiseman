WISEMAN 1.0

This is the 1.0 binary release of Wiseman, an open-source implementation of the WS-Management 
protocol for JDK 5.0 and better.

This release provides full coverage of the WS-Management 1.0(version a) specification
which can be found at http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman. We have added a lot more 
formal documentation located in the docs directory of this release. To begin learning 
about Wiseman you are encouraged to start there.

As with other good open-source software projects, you will will also find the CVS resources and 
specifically the unit tests for the Wiseman project to be a valuable source or more indepth 
coverage/examples of WS-Management usage. If you need to see how something is done and you haven't
found it in the formalized documentation you are encouraged to investigate the source code and 
submit you enhancements and questions to the following url.  

Please send any questions or comments to:

		users@wiseman.dev.java.net
		
###NOTE: Due to bugs uncovered in tools that we depend upon(JDK and ANT releases), you are 
encouraged to use JDK 1.5.0_12 version(or better) and ANT 1.6.5 for best results. 

Thank you for using Wiseman 1.0.  We look forward to your feedback.
