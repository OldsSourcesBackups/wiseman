WISEMAN 0.5

Welcome to the first release of Wiseman, an implementation of the WS Management 
protocol for Java JDK 5.0.

This release provides good coverage of the WS Man 1.0 specification
which can be found at http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman. Documentation
is still under development for this product and will be added soon.

To begin learning about Wiseman look over the samples in the samples 
directory and try the Creating Resources tutorial in the docs directory.

You will also find the unit tests for wiseman to be a useful source 
of examples. Unit tests for the client and server (SE) projects are provided
including tests used in the last multi vendor interop which cover most of
the specification. If you need to see how something is done look there
as well.

Please send any questions or comments to:
