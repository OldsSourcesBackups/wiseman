WISEMAN 0.6

This is the second binary release of Wiseman, an implementation of the WS Management 
protocol for Java JDK 5.0.

This release provides good coverage of the WS Man 1.0 specification
which can be found at http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman. Documentation
is still under development for this product and will be updated soon.

To begin learning about Wiseman look over the samples in the samples 
directory and try the 'Creating Resources' tutorial in the docs directory.  
NOTE: Some instructional areas of this tutorial are no longer valid with this release.
Some of the generated artifacts have changed since the 0.5 release. The next binary 
release of this product will provide a comprehensive rework of the current 
documentation. It was determined that further efforts to resynchronize the 
documentation would better be spent on new features.

While learning more about Wiseman, you will also find the unit tests for wiseman to 
be a useful source of examples. Unit tests for the client and server (SE) projects 
are provided including tests used in the last multi vendor interop which cover most 
of the specification. If you need to see how something is done look there as well.
