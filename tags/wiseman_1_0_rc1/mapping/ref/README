Download the desired version of the CIM Schema in MOF format from
http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim and unzip it in a suitable dir.
For example, the CIM version 2.11 MOFs from dmtf could go in
the mof/dmtf/2.11 subdirectory. 

Edit the ref.mof.dir property in <basedir>/project.properties to
point to the directory where the source MOFs can be found.

If working on Windows, move (for example for cim version 2.11), 
cimv211.mof to cim-v2.11-windows.mof. The format for the name of the
destination file is cim-v<cim-version>-<platform>.mof. If working on
Solaris or Linux, substitute <platform> with "unix" and edit the file
to replace all backslashes ("\") with forward slashes ("/").
