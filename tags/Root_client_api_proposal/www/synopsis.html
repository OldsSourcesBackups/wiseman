<h3>Wiseman in a Nutshell</h3>

<p>WS-Management is an open standard that re-defines how existing WS-* specifications should be used
and how additional service metadata can be detailed to build out compliant webservices.
As an implementation of the WS-Management protocol, Wiseman provides both client and server side
APIs for building valid WS-Management messages. Wiseman leverages the java Servlet Engine model as 
as the funamental base, on the server side, for exposing WS-Management instances.  The wep application 
model is an extensible mechanism for constructing webservices as enterprise level functionality is easily 
achieved by embedding the webapp in a J2EE Application Server. Wiseman is model agnostic, and requires 
that the XML representation of the model-specific elements of your service be desribed by Xml Schema 
Definition(XSD) and ultimately representable as org.w3c.dom.* elements. Service developers may employ a 
JAVA&lt;=&gt;XML binding technology of their choice for model specific serialization and now spend more time on
application/model specific behavior than on protocol specific details.  The following figure may help to
show how WS-Managment services are built with Wiseman:</br>
