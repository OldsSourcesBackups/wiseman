XSDs

If validation is desired, copy here the various XSDs for XML, SOAP, 
WS-Addressing, WS-Eventing, WS-Transfer, WS-Enumeration, WS-Management 
and WS-Management Identity. 

Note that this is an all-or-none thing - either all the XSDs are 
present in which case they'll be used for validation, or none of them 
are present in which case validation will be turned off. The presence 
of a subset of the XSDs will cause errors such as -

WARNING: null
javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException
 - with linked exception:
[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'wsen:Enumerate'.]
        at javax.xml.bind.helpers.AbstractUnmarshallerImpl.createUnmarshalException(AbstractUnmarshallerImpl.java:315)
        at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.unmarshaller.UnmarshallerImpl.createUnmarshalException(UnmarshallerImpl.java:481)
        at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.unmarshaller.UnmarshallerImpl.unmarshal0(UnmarshallerImpl.java:303)
        at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.unmarshaller.UnmarshallerImpl.unmarshal(UnmarshallerImpl.java:276)
        at com.sun.ws.management.xml.XmlBinding.unmarshal(XmlBinding.java:115)
        at com.sun.ws.management.server.WSManServlet.handleIfIdentify(WSManServlet.java:289)
...

To be able to run the unit tests with validation, also copy here all the XSDs 
from test/etc/xsd.

As of June 2006, the WS-Management and WS-Management Identity XSDs are
not yet available publically, so current drafts need to be downloaded 
from the Committee Drafts folder of the DMTF WS-Management WG -

http://www.dmtf.org/apps/org/workgroup/wsman/documents.php

These schemas need to be edited slightly to make them work with JAXB - 
delete the schemaLocation attribute and its value in all import 
statements. For example -

-  <xs:import namespace="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing" 
-	schemaLocation="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing" />
+  <xs:import namespace="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing" />

Custom and Model XSDs should also be placed here if validation is 
desired.

The XSDs are loaded in alphabetic order, so in order to ensure that
dependencies are loaded first, the XSD filenames could be named, for
example, as follows -

1-xml.xsd
2-soap.xsd
3-addressing.xsd
3-identity.xsd
4-eventing.xsd
4-transfer.xsd
4-enumeration.xsd
5-management.xsd

(and for example)...

6-model-core.xsd
7-models.xsd
8-vendor-extensions.xsd
...
